# ZT Zip Progress Bar

This is a simple example on how to implement a progress bar for zip packing using [zt-zip](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-zip). See [Main.java](https://github.com/toomasr/zt-zip-progress-bar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/toomasr/zip/progressbar/Main.java) for the example.

# Running the Example

In the terminal issue the following commands. The example relies on `\r` being processed as terminals usually do so make sure you run it in a terminal!

```
mvn install
java -jar target/progress-bar.jar
```
